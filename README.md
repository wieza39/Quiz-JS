# Quiz-JS

Here you can find my project for university subject related with front-end fundamentals. <br>
Tech-stack I kept raw, so I used plain css and js, without any frameworks. Idea was to understand foundations rather copy solution without reflection. <br>
<br>
The main functionalities I provided in this small project are:
  * Ask and remember players name
  * Introduce basic rules
  * During a game, display current score and player's name
  * Show timer, which finishes game, when time is over
  * Two types of questions (2 and 4 answers)
  * Display questions in random order
  * After game, show gained points and congratulate
  * Confetti effect (animated in css)
  * Provide options from last screen:
    * New game (new player)
    * Rematch
    * Display leaderboard + possibility to step back from it
<br>
Below you can see screenshots also.
